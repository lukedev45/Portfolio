# My First Website 🌐

Hi, I’m Luke 👋  
I’m an **Applied Mathematics & Physics student** with a strong interest in **quantum science, data science, and engineering**.  

This repo contains my **first basic website**, built only with HTML, as part of my journey into web development and project building.  

## 🔧 About Me
- 🎓 Studying Applied Mathematics & Physics  
- 💡 Interests: Quantum technologies, data science, AI, and engineering applications  
- 🌱 Learning web development & software tools to showcase my projects  
- 🛠️ I like working on technical projects that combine science, coding, and creativity  

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here
- A very simple HTML site — the starting point for my portfolio  
- Future projects will include more advanced sites, tools, and technical experiments  

## 🚀 Next Steps
I’ll continue updating this repo as I grow my skills, moving from static HTML pages to interactive projects that highlight my work.
