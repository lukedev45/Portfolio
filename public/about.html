  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Luke Devlin</strong>, an Applied Mathematics &amp; Physics student with a practical streak for
    building things that make work easier. I’m especially interested in the crossroads of
    <strong>quantum science</strong>, <strong>data science</strong>, and <strong>engineering</strong>. Lately, my focus has
    been on creating lightweight <em>AI agents</em> and automations that search company servers, extract the right
    project information, and assemble clean technical submittals,freeing up time for deeper design work.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve earned the IBM <em>Basics of Quantum Information</em> certificate and became a Qiskit Advocate, which pushed me
    to explain complex ideas clearly and mentor others. I enjoy turning messy, real-world requirements into tidy,
    repeatable workflows,whether that’s a Python script, an n8n pipeline, or a Word/Excel automation on Windows.
    On the data side, I’m building strong foundations in statistics, machine learning, and reproducible tooling so my
    projects are trustworthy and easy to maintain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond engineering, I like teaching (I’ve tutored maths and guitar) and sharing what I learn in accessible ways.
    I value clear structure, small iterative wins, and documentation that stands on its own. Over the next year, I’m
    growing my portfolio with hands-on projects across quantum, automation, and web,each one aimed at solving a real
    problem and showcasing solid engineering judgement.
