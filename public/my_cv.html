        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a self taught software engineer with a deep passion for quantum computing and AI.
            I am currently working for compnay known as Prinicipal HVAC as a data analyst.
            I have a strong foundation in mathematics and physics due to my academic background and I believe this has enabled me to think about problems in a unique way.
            I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
